Click the button to play Asteroids

- Ship will always point at your mouse cursor
- Left click to use thrusters
- Right click to shoot
- Space bar to use the 'Space Breaks' (Stops the Ship)

- Be careful, each shot will recoil the ship, 
    and if you shoot an asteroid, the momentum of the blast will transfer to the target

If you set a new personal HI SCORE it will be recorded in the database
(U)

And if you so choose, you may delete your account (and your HI SCORE)
